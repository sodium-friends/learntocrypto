# 06. Our first crypto primitive (hashing)

Now that we have a running bank and a threat model with a high risk target,
let's look at what we can do to mitigate this risk. As mentioned previously,
in this workshop we will be using the cryptographic library called `libsodium`,
exposed to Javascript by the `sodium-native` module. This suite of primitives
has a strong focus on being user friendly, hard to misuse and being
"high level". Many of the primitives we will be looking at here also have
equivalents in the core `crypto` module, which is based on OpenSSL.

## Side quest

`sodium-native` is a native module, which in itself can be a side quest to
install. However we, @mafintosh and @emilbayes, try hard to provide prebuilt
binaries for all major platforms and releases of node and electron. This means
you shouldn't have to compile anything when installing the module.

```sh
npm install sodium-native
```

## Buffers

One of the fundamental building blocks that make cryptography practical and
safe (and fun!) in Javascript is the core `Buffer` prototype. `Buffer`s today
are the same as `Uint8Arrays` with some extra methods to make working with them
easier. `Buffer`s in node is the closest you get to raw memory access, but in a
safe manner, so you don't have overflow bugs, like in C/C++. Below are some of
the most important `Buffer` methods that you will be using in the workshop,
namely allocating a specific number of bytes, checking for equality and
converting the Buffer back to something that is a printable string:

```js
// Creating buffers
Buffer.alloc(32) // Allocate empty 32 byte Buffer
Buffer.from('Hello, World!') // Allocate buffer and write 'Hello world'
Buffer.from('48656c6c6f20776f726c64', 'hex') // Decode string from `hex`
Buffer.alloc(32).fill('Hello') // Allocate 32 byte Buffer and repeat 'Hello'

buf1.equals(buf2) // Check whether buf1 and buf2 are equal byte by byte

// Converting to printable strings
buf.toString('hex') // Octets in as hexadecimal
buf.toString('base64') // Octets as ascii safe string (base64)
```

Being intimate with `Buffer`s is key to working efficiently with crypto.

## Another side quest

Try spinning up a node REPL and play around with the Buffer commands listed
above. For example, try generating a 13 byte `Buffer` and write `Hello, World!`
to it. Also try with a 32 byte `Buffer` and see the difference. Decoding
different encodings such as `hex` and `base64` is also very important for later
exercises.

## Hashing

Hash functions are a class of mathematical functions that transform an arbitrary
sequence of data into a fixed size digest. The digest is also often called a
hash or a fingerprint, because the idea is that a hash function should produce
a unique result for any every unique piece of data. There are many varieties of
hash functions, but here we will only work with cryptographically secure hash
functions.

Cryptographic hash functions provide a much strong guarantee regarding the
uniqueness of the fingerprint, but at the cost of requiring more computation,
and hence, time. However for the particular hash function used by `libsodium`,
context switching from V8 to C will be a bottleneck before hashing is :)

In `libsodium` the general purpose hash function is called BLAKE2b, and is
exposed as [`crypto_generichash(outputBuf, inputBuf, [key])`](https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-native#generic-hashing).

## Problem

Write a new program, `hash-example.js`. Using `sodium-native` try hashing the
string `"Hello, World!"` using the `sodium.crypto_generichash` primitive and
print out the result as a `hex` string. Have a look at the constants defined in
the `sodium-native` documentation (especially the `crypto_generichash_BYTES`),
as these are important guidelines for working effectively with `libsodium`.

# Testing

Running your program it should produce the output
`511bc81dde11180838c562c82bb35f3223f46061ebde4a955c27b3f489cf1e03`.
