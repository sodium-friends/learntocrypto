# 03. Withdrawing schmeckels

Not much fun depositing schmeckels with your bank if you can't retrieve them
again! The next task is simply extending the bank, teller and transaction log
with a `withdraw` command.

```js

```

## Problem

Add a `withdraw` command, that `.push`es this new entry to the transaction log
and handle the command type when calculating your balance. Remember to check for
sufficient funds (unless your government does bailouts). Also add a new command
to your teller client.

## Testing

Restart your `bank.js` and try making a couple of deposits and withdrawals. You
should try and withdraw more money than is available in the bank, and have your
command be refused.
